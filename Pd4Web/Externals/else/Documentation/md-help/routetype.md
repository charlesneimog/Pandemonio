[routetype] routes messages according to its type, such as "bang", "float", "list" and "symbol". There is also the "anything" type, which is can be defined as "any other" message that is not the former ones.
These 5 types are given as arguments, and there's an outlet corresponding to each given argument that sends out the message type according to the arguments(bang", "float", "list", "symbol" or "any").
